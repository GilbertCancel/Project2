Project #2 Rummy_Card_Game

The purpose of these Java codes is to simulate a Rummy card game.
However in this instance a computer player has not been initialized and thus the game is made to be played by 2 human players. 
The game will continue until one player hits 52 points in their hand.
However the points will not be counted from the starting cards in an effort to not end the game on the first turn if 1 player gets lucky.
(The 52 points can be changed in the No_morecards method in the Table.java file)

This project is available on my personal Github page. However this project was developed on replit so you may also 
find the project here: https://replit.com/join/drhejdsu-gilbertocancel
(Note that Proj2.java was changed to Main.java and the project may take a couple of minutes to display the GUI.)
Also replit may not display the entire GUI at first, you need to drag the window by the blue bar where it says "A Card Game".
Drag that to the left until you can see the button to enlarge the GUI so you can see the entire GUI.

IMPORTANT
I am not solely responsible for this project.
Most of the code was provided by Patricia Ordo√±ez.

The project was possible through the help of other students in the CCOM4029 class.
Many debugging sessions were needed to get the project runinng and I would like to thank my peers for their advice and aid.

Unfortunatly Github will not allow me to upload the card images directly so I had to place them in a zip file.
